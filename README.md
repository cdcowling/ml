**Streamlit is required for the website to run, (assuming you're in the correct directory) it can be run using**
> streamlit run streamlit_app.py
If you do not have streamlit installed in anaconda, you can run:
> conda install streamlit
The notebook should not require any other modules if you run it using the anaconda kernel.

The website is available at: cdcowling.streamlit.app
